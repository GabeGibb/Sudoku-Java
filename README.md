# Sudoku-Java

- Original Repo: https://github.com/Michael595555555/Sudoku
A Sudoku desktop app that I helped guide my student Michael through. The app is made using java and the StdDraw java graphics library. The sudoku app is fully playable, has different difficulties,
quality of life improvements like pencil marks, and even has a built in solver that uses 2 seperate solving algorithms to find solutions to any solvable sudoku quickly.
